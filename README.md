# iOS geofencing demo
## User stories
- **User story 1.** As a user of the application, I want to be able to start a journey by clicking the "Start" button, and then end the journey by clicking the "Stop" button. It should be one button, but the title should change depending on the mode.
- **User story 2.** As a user of the application, I have to receive a permission request to use location.
- **User story 3.** As a user of the app, every time I open the app, I have to see a list of pictures from Flickr that are tied to the user's location during the journey every 100 meters. New pictures should be at the top. Whenever the user takes a look at their phone, they see the most recent picture and can scroll through a stream of pictures that shows where the user has been.
- **User story 4.** As a user of the app, I should be able to use the travel mode for at least a two-hour walk.
